#### Context
The general field in which our research can be situated is Film Studies, a sector concerned
with exploring the narrative, artistic, cultural, economic, and political implications of the
cinema.
In particular we are interested in adopting a postcolonial perspective as a critical approach
to the analysis of production, theoretical frameworks, contexts and creation of films.
To do so, our study will consider the history of films and the reciprocal influence between
USA and East Asian cinema production, hence adopting the tools and methods of citation
analysis studies.

#### Problem and Motivation
The problem we aspire to address within this study is the power asymmetries underlying
the ever present vision of history of Cinema as Hollywood-centered, as well as how eastern
cinema has been incorporated in western cinema, often without fully acknowledging the
sources, hence undermining the role of the foreign artistic influence; or how it affected the
representation of the Other, shaping the perception and history of foreign identities.
As a compass to better navigate this field of studies we draw knowledge from two main
texts:

● Postcolonial Cinema Studies, edited by Sandra Ponzanesi, and Marguerite Waller,
Taylor & Francis Group, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central<br>

● East Asian Cinemas, Exploring Transnational Connections on Film, edited by Leon
Hunt & Leung Wing-Fai, I.B Tauris & Co Ltd, New York, 2008
Moreover, we are taking inspiration from Spitz and Horvàt’s Network Analysis study
Unraveling Cinematic Citation1 where light is shed «on the potential of a systematic
quantitative investigation based on cinematic influences in identifying the most inspiring
creations in world cinema».
2 Their main contribution was to create for the first time a
movie rank based on the historical importance of movies, beyond traditional measures of
success, such as box-office revenue and critical acclaim, which are external to the craft of
the movie itself.
